  <h1>Monica Dinculescu</h1>

  <p>I've just ended an 8 year stint as a Senior Engineer at Google, where I worked on
    making music and art and all sorts of creative interactions with Machine Learning,
    web components and web standards, and the guts of Chromium.
    You can read a bit more about me over <a href="/about">here</a>. Most of
    my personal code is on <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf">GitHub</a> or
    on <a href="https://glitch.com/@notwaldorf">Glitch</a>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="rainbow">Writing</h3>
  <p>I'm giving it a shot at writing weekly notes. You can browse the full
    <a href="/weaknotes">archive</a>, for as long as I manage to keep it up ðŸ˜….
    I also occasionally <a href="/blog">blog</a> about tech things that
    I've learnt or enjoyed, though the frequency of posts has really
    decreased lately. Here are some recent posts:
  </p>

  <ul class="listing table">
    {% for post in site.posts limit:10 %}
    {% unless post.draft %}
    {% capture currentdate %}{{post.date | date: "%Y"}}{% endcapture %}
    <li>
      <span>{{ post.date | date: "%B %e, %Y" }}</span> <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endunless %}
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

    <b>RSS feeds</b>: <a href="/atom.xml">the firehose</a> | <a href="/blog.xml">just the blog</a> | <a href="/weaknotes.xml">just the weaknotes</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h3 class="rainbow">Projects</h3>
  <p>I build very small (but cute, I think!)
    <a href="/projects">side projects</a>
    that are either an attempt at "art", or are a thing that I need in my
    life and can't find elsewhere (like, practicing ASL fingerspelling,
    ukulele chords, or uhhhh understanding time keeping in JavaScript).
  </p>

  <p>I sometimes also give <a href="/talks">talks</a> at conferences, though
    the pandemic has really thrown a wrench into that.</p>
