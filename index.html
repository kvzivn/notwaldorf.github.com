<p>I've just ended an 8 year stint as a Senior Engineer at Google, where I worked on
  making music and art and all sorts of creative interactions with Machine Learning,
  web components and web standards, and the guts of Chromium.
  You can read a bit more about me over <a href="/about">here</a>. Most of
  my personal code is on <a href="https://github.com/notwaldorf">GitHub</a> or
  on <a href="https://glitch.com/@notwaldorf">Glitch</a>.
</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>I'm giving it a shot at writing weekly notes. You can browse the full
  <a href="/weaknotes">archive</a>, for as long as I manage to keep it up ðŸ˜….
  I also occasionally <a href="/blog">blog</a> about tech things that
  I've learnt or enjoyed, though the frequency of posts has really
  decreased lately.

</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>I build very small (but cute, I think!)
  <a href="/projects">side projects</a>
  that are either an attempt at "art", or are a thing that I need in my
  life and can't find elsewhere (like, practicing ASL fingerspelling,
  ukulele chords, or uhhhh understanding time keeping in JavaScript).
</p>

<p>I sometimes also give <a href="/talks">talks</a> at conferences, though
  the pandemic has really thrown a wrench into that.</p>
