<p id="alice-gets-credit">* <a href="https://alicebartlett.co.uk/">Alice Bartlett</a> calls her week
  notes "weak", a rare pun that I deeply appreciate. You can follow my notes
  via <a href="https://meowni.ca/weaknotes.xml">RSS</a>. This is a different RSS feed than the regular posts, by the
  way! </p>
