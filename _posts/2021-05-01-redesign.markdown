The last time I redid my site was 2 years ago. I was really into gradient text and IBM Plex Mono. It was a mild increment over whatever I had before, which was just a cleaned up and colourful version of [Left](https://zachholman.com/left/) from like 6 years prior. Even websites get split ends, so it was time for a yearly haircut. Here's the before and after:

# Why
I used to write a lot of blog posts, so my website was very listing focus. Originally my home page was just a listing of my blog posts, but as I started switching teams and working on more things I had to insert some copy. As the pandemic hit, I started writing fewer and fewer posts, so having the one post of 2020 show up as a listing was ridiculous.

Also this year I started focusing a lot more on making generative art and I thought it was sad I wasn't showing that anywhere on the site! The beauty of generative art is that you can just keep generating it over and over again....surely perfect for a website, right?

## Things that I like
- Loved the idea of the gradient titles. It made a website about JavaScript look cute.
- I'd be okay throwing out the gradients if I there was a different form of cute.

# Things I'm over
- IBM Plex Mono and friends. I still love monospace, but I change my fonts like I do my hair colour, and that is to say: a lot.
- White, colourless pages. I'd like some splashes of colour!
