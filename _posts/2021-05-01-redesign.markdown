 also even websites get split ends, so it was time for
a little yearly trim. also i recently helped a friend redesign her site, and it made me think a lot about
how i would do this exercise as a helpful 3rd party.

# Why
- i uased to write a lot of blog posts, so my index page was basically a listing of all my posts. Nowadays
i do less talking and more thinking, so i wanted that to come through.
- haven't done a lighthouse in a minute and im scared


# Things that i like
- love those gradient titles. want it to remain cute.

# Things I'm over
- too many links at the top
- IBM plex mono and friends
- need to showcase more
- very white colourless content
