  <h1>Hiya!</h1>

  <p>I just ended my stint as a Senior Engineer at Google, where I worked on <a href="http://magenta.tensorflow.org">Magenta</a>,
    making music and art with Machine Learning. In 2020 I did a 6 month fellowship
    with the Trevor project, where I lead a team that worked on classifying suicidal
    ideation posts. </p>

  <p>Prior to 2018, I worked on <a href="https://polymer-project.org">Polymer</a>,
    and was a big advocate for Web Components. Before that, I used to work on
    <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chrome</a>. Do you know that little button that has appeared in top right corner
    of your browser? Yeah, I did that (but now it looks different.
    It's been 6+ years after all). Before that, I worked in Finance, despite
    not really understanding anything about it. I have a masters in Computer Science
    from <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>. I wrote a thesis on Reinforcement Learning,
    which you can read <a href="/includes/mdinculescu_thesis.pdf">here</a>, though I'm not sure why you would.

  <p>I've recently started making more art and selling it on my <a href="https://meownica.studio">only shop</a>, 
  which is something I've wanted to do all my life!</p>

  <h3 class="rainbow">If you want to say hi: </h3>
  <p>My social media hell of choice is <a href="https://twitter.com/notwaldorf">Twitter</a>, where I'm pretty responsive. 
    I also have a GitHub AMA <a
      href="https://github.com/notwaldorf/ama">repo</a>
    where you can ask me things, or read what other people have asked me.
    If you really need to, you can send me an <a href="mailto:mdinculescu@gmail.com">email</a>,
    but know that it'll take me an embarassing time to reply.
    It's not you, it's misplaced anxiety.</p>

  <h3 class="rainbow">If you're a conference and you need a bio: </h3>
  <p>Monica works on Magenta, in Google Brain, where she makes generative music
    and art with Machine Learning. In the past she's worked
    on Polymer, Web Components, and Chrome, and has probably at least once broken the Internet for you.
    She is passionate about delightful user experiences, unreasonably excited about emoji, wary of web fonts, and will
    become your best friend if you bring her
    cheese. On second thought, she may be a mouse.</p>

  <p>If you need a headshot, I recommend <a href="https://meowni.ca/images/headshot.jpg">this
      one</a>. (Thanks to <a href="https://www.pujaarajan.com">Pujaa Rajan</a> for
    making me look like a respectable adult!)</p>
